        <p>
          Hi, I'm Patrick Cunningham. As a sophomore at UIUC, I've developed a deep interest in machine learning, artificial intelligence and software engineering.

          <br><br>
          I've honed my leadership and technical skills through my experiences as an undergraduate researcher and a course assistant, and I'm eager to apply these skills to make breakthrough discoveries. 
          <br><br>
          In addition to my research, I've developed a mobile application in a software design lab, giving me a strong foundation in machine learning and web development. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm excited to see where my journey takes me.

        <p style="text-align: left">
          Building a full-scale website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS has been a creative journey for me. 
          While I've had experience working with these languages, I never had the opportunity to use them 
          with such creativity. Designing a website requires scrutinizing every decision from scroll speed 
          to background color, and it's challenging to find a perfect match. However, through this process, 
          I've learned a lot about web development and myself as a creative person. 
          <br><br>
          This experience of building something for myself, outside of the academic realm, has been extremely valuable. Unlike school projects t
          hat end after completion, I'm always thinking of ways to improve my website and make it look better. 
          This project has also pushed me out of my comfort zone. I used to fear criticism and hid behind the 
          saying "it's just not ready yet," but now I realize that programming is a continuous process of 
          learning and improvement. Though my current work may not be perfect, I'm constantly learning how 
          to make it better each day.

      <div class="content">
        <p style="text-align: left">
          In my most recent semester, I took challenging computer science (CS) courses and completed the last 
          of my required math classes. As a sophomore returning to campus, I felt more confident in both my 
          personal and academic life. CS 225, the fundamental course for all CS majors, introduced me to various 
          sorting and graph algorithms and taught me about data structures. The course involved coding and projects, 
          which were both rewarding and enjoyable to work on.
          <br><br>
          In CS 222, a project-based class, I had the opportunity to work with a team of students throughout the 
          semester to create a final project, which included building a machine learning mobile application. This 
          class taught me the importance of programming in a team setting and also introduced me to web and mobile
          development.
          <br><br>
          I also took CS 361, a challenging stats and probability class that initially presented difficulties 
          due to my lack of experience in the subject. However, by the end of the course, I had developed a
          better understanding of the concepts and was able to apply many stats concepts in unique ways such as 
          with machine learning. Lastly, I took MATH 257, a linear algebra course that helped me appreciate the importance of linear 
          algebra in programming. Through this class, I learned that almost anything can be represented as a 
          matrix, and how to perform calculations with it.

      <div class="content">
        <p style="text-align: left">
          The second semester was the turning point when college became truly challenging for me. As I tackled more programming and advanced math courses, 
          my academic abilities were pushed to their limits. Unlike the previous semester, where I felt less pressure during finals week, this semester was a 
          different story. I enrolled in CS 128, an introduction to C++ programming, CS 173, a complex course on discrete structures that was one of the most 
          demanding CS courses I've taken to date, and Calc 3. Despite the challenges, I enjoyed CS 128 as it allowed me to write code and solve unique problems. 
          <br><br>
          The MP assignments, such as seam carver and mountain paths, were particularly difficult, but the final product was worth the effort. CS 173 was equally challenging, 
          but it taught me the importance of dedication and consistent effort in learning. At the start of the course, the symbols and concepts like induction 
          seemed like a foreign language to me, but I eventually grasped the material through many hours of studying, practicing, and seeking help. Although 
          it was the toughest course of the semester, it also became one of my favorites. 
          <br><br>
          As for Calc 3, I've always loved math, and this course was no exception. 
          While it was not an easy course, I felt prepared for it, thanks to the rigor of Calc 2. Outside of my classes, I was also part of a research group under 
          the mentorship of Yogi Patel. The experience was amazing, and I got to learn about research basics and use some of the top-notch facilities available on 
          campus, such as the Siebel Center for design.

          Although I didn't write about my first semester right away, 
          the memories are still fresh enough in my mind to reflect on 
          what went well and what didn't. I recall being eager and excited 
          to learn everything about programming and engineering when I started 
          college. However, I soon realized that finding like-minded peers 
          was just as crucial as academic success. It was a stark contrast 
          to high school, where I knew everyone who walked down the hall. 
          Trying to make new friends among 50,000 students felt daunting.
          <br><br>
          As my first semester progressed, I gradually learned how to be 
          an efficient student. While I maintained some of the study habits 
          I had developed in high school, I also had to adapt to new challenges.
          Mastering the discipline to sit at my desk for hours with minimal distractions 
          was a skill that took effort to develop, and one that I still struggle with today.
          <br><br>
          The classes I took in my first semester were not particularly difficult. 
          I enrolled in an introductory programming course, which was one of the 
          best-run classes I've taken in college to date. The satisfaction of finally
          starting down the career path that I wanted motivated me to succeed. I also 
          took Calc 2, a challenging math course that revealed how little I knew about 
          the world of mathematics and how much harder college could be. Lastly, I took 
          a world history class that covered the entire universe's life, from the Big Bang 
          to the 2020 presidential election.
