        <p>
          Hi, I'm Patrick Cunningham. As a sophomore at UIUC, I've developed a deep interest in machine learning, artificial intelligence and software engineering.

          <br><br>
          I've honed my leadership and technical skills through my experiences as an undergraduate researcher and a course assistant, and I'm eager to apply these skills to make breakthrough discoveries. 
          <br><br>
          In addition to my research, I've developed a mobile application in a software design lab, giving me a strong foundation in machine learning and web development. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm excited to see where my journey takes me.

      <div class="content">
        <p style="text-align: left">
          This is my first time building a full-scale website with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. While I have a lot of experience working with these languages I have never had the opportunity to utilize them with such creativity. Throughout this entire process, I feel like I have learned a lot about not only web development but also myself as a creative. It is very difficult to decide what you want your website to look like Every decision from the scroll speed to the background color needs to be scrutinized. No matter how many example websites you look at it’s hard to find one that perfectly encapsulates what you want. <br><br>
          Building something for myself has also been a very valuable experience. Before building this website all of my work had been academically focused. Once I finished a project for a class, that was it, there was no more continuation of the project. There was also not as much motivation to produce a result you were proud of, as long as it passed the test cases you were good. Building a website, however, has been different. Throughout the day I am always thinking about things I could add to my website, different style choices I could implement, and just generally how to make it look nicer. It is more motivating to work on something that you know will benefit you. <br><br>
          Finally, working on this project has taught me a lot about branching out of my comfort zone. For years I have been petrified to publish any of my code or display any of my work for fear of criticism. The saying “it’s just not ready yet” has been a barrier for me to hide behind. I have come to realize that programming is a process, and while the current state of my work may not be exactly where I want it to be, I am learning more and more each day about how to improve it. <br>

          While I did not write this during my first semester, it is still fresh enough in my mind were I can reflect on what went well and what didn’t. I remember entering my first semester of college excited and ready to learn everything there is about programming and engineering. What I also came to learn about was the need to find people that you fit in. It is a major wake-up call from the days of high school when you knew everyone who walked down the hall. Now having to find new friends in a school of 50,000 kids certainly felt overwhelming.<br><br>

What I learned gradually through my first semester was how to be an efficient student. I felt like many of the attributes that I had built in high cool stuck with me, but I learned how to study more robust situations. Learning how to have the discipline to sit at your desk for hours at a time with minimal distractions to study was certainly a skill I had to work hard to master and still struggle with today.<br><br>

The class I took this semester were not particularly hard. I took my first introductory programming course, which to this day is the best-run class I have taken in college. I think it was also the joy of finally starting down the career path that I knew I wanted that really motivated me to succeed. I also took Calc 2, a difficult math class that certainly opened my eyes as to how much I didn’t know about the world of mathematics, and how much harder school can really get. I also took a world history class that spanned the entire life of the universe, all the way from the Big Bang to the 2020 presidential election. <br><br>
